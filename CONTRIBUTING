The short version:
 * Patches should have a good summary line for first line of commit message
 * Patch series should be sent primarily as Merge Requests[1] or to the
   Google Group[0]
 * Patch needs to do exactly one thing
 * test suite passes (enforced by continuous integration)

The longer version:

We use a variant of Mercurial's own contribution
system. https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/ContributingChanges contains
their full guidelines. Key differences are (by rule number):

 1. For hg-git, we're not strict about the "topic: a few words" format
    for the first line, but do insist on a sensible summary as the
    first commit line
 2. You can cross-reference Heptapod issues in the #NNN format
 10. We use mostly pep8 style. The current codebase is a mess, but new
     code should be basically pep8.

To submit a Merge Request, please ask for Developer rights using the
'Request access' link. Then, following the instructions of the following
tutorial should be enough:
https://heptapod.net/pages/quick-start-guide.html

If you do a Merge Request, we're still going to expect you to
provide a clean history, and to be willing to rework history so it's
clean before we push the "merge" button.
